======

Galaxy is a library-agnostic javascript implmentation of the mediator/sandbox. Galaxy allows your objects to be de-coupled and communicate with each other through a mediator.


Purpose
=====

 Galaxy provides a fleixble pattern to be used with your existing architcture instead of forcing you to use a pre-defined structure. It is up to you how you utilize Galaxy.
