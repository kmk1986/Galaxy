About
======

Galaxy is a library-agnostic javascript implmentation of the mediator/sandbox. Galaxy allows your objects to be de-coupled and commnucate with each other through a mediator.


Goal
=====

Galaxy doesn't try to be a framework. Its goal is to provide a fleixble pattern to be used with your existing architcture instead of forcing you to use a pre-defined structure. It is up to you how you use Galaxy.
